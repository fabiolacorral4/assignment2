assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information given
in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab in the file
~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the readme file,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It was helpful but way too time-consuming

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

samplereplace always gave me errors (even lab tas couldnt help me figure
this out), so although the output looks correct when testing with 
individual files, the output of replace.c never passes the testreplace tests

------------------------------------------------------------------------

replace.c: line 40: low priority: 
This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

replace.c: line 45: low priority: 
This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring


My dissagrement would be that the logic necessary for this program
required these deep nestings

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No, unless you call assert within a loop, using assert could only
check whether the beginning of the destination string is null or not
